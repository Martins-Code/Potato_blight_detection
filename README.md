# **Potato Blight Detection**

🌱 **A Machine Learning Project for Detecting Potato Plant Diseases**  
This repository hosts a TensorFlow-based solution to identify and classify blight in potato plants. Leveraging cutting-edge deep learning techniques, this project aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in early disease detection, improving crop management and yield.

## **Project Overview**

Potato plants are vulnerable to various diseases, such as early blight and late blight, which can severely impact productivity. This project aims to provide an efficient solution for disease detection using image classification techniques.

- **Technologies Used**: TensorFlow, Python, and Jupyter Notebook
- **Dataset**: Images sourced from the [PlantVillage dataset](https://www.plantvillage.org).
- **Classes**:
  - 🥔 **Potato - Early Blight**
  - 🥔 **Potato - Late Blight**
  - 🥔 **Potato - Healthy**
